Task 3: Basic SELECT Queries - Detailed Explanation
Overview
This task focuses on mastering data retrieval from a Pharmacovigilance (PV) database using basic SQL SELECT statements. The objective is to understand how to extract, filter, and organize data effectively.

Tables Used:

Patients - Patient demographic information
Reporters - Individuals/organizations reporting adverse events
Reports - Adverse event reports
Drugs - Medication information
Reactions - Adverse reactions/side effects
Lookup Tables - Reference data for codes


Concepts Covered
1. SELECT * (All Columns)
What it does: Retrieves all columns from a table
Logic: The asterisk (*) is a wildcard meaning "everything"
Examples in Task:


2. SELECT Specific Columns (Projection)
What it does: Retrieves only specified columns
Logic: List the exact columns you need, separated by commas

3. WHERE Clause (Filtering)
What it does: Filters rows based on conditions
Logic: Only rows meeting the condition are returned

4. AND Operator
What it does: Combines multiple conditions (all must be true)
Logic: Row must satisfy ALL conditions to be included

5. OR Operator
What it does: Combines conditions where at least one must be true
Logic: Row is included if ANY condition is satisfied

6. Combining AND & OR
What it does: Creates complex filters with multiple logical conditions
Logic: Use parentheses to control evaluation order (like math)

7. LIKE Operator (Pattern Matching)
What it does: Searches for patterns in text columns
Logic: Uses wildcards to match partial strings

8. BETWEEN Operator
What it does: Checks if a value falls within a range
Logic: Inclusive of both boundary values (includes start and end)

9. IN Operator
What it does: Checks if a value matches any value in a list
Logic: Alternative to multiple OR conditions, more concise

10. ORDER BY (Sorting)
What it does: Sorts query results
Logic:

ASC = Ascending (default) - smallest to largest, A-Z
DESC = Descending - largest to smallest, Z-A

11. LIMIT Clause
What it does: Restricts the number of rows returned
Logic: Returns only the first N rows from the result set

12. DISTINCT Keyword
What it does: Removes duplicate values from results
Logic: Returns only unique values/combinations

13. Column Aliasing (AS Keyword)
What it does: Renames columns in output for readability
Logic: Creates a temporary name for a column in the result set


14. NULL Handling
What it does: Filters based on missing (NULL) or existing values
Logic:

IS NULL finds missing values
IS NOT NULL finds existing values
Cannot use = NULL (incorrect syntax)

15. Comparison Operators
What it does: Compares values for filtering
Operators:

= Equal to
!= or <> Not equal to
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

These concepts were used and applied in the task.
